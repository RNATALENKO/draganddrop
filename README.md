# draganddrop

This task board let's you create productivity tasks, color code them, and drag and drop them when they're done. Some bugs still remain like the title of the task can get too long and become hidden slicing right through the letter. And the color palette, when you add too many colors the list stretches out. I don't think I will go back to fix these bugs because I've moved onto a large full stack mobile app that has it's own set of bugs that need to be worked out. But the core functionality of this app operates flawlessly, which is the most important. I should also add that this mostly uses local storage to store the tasks data. So if you clear your cache, your task board will clear also. It adds, removes, and updates task information in lists that are stored locally.
